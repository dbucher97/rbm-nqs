# Kitaev Honeycomb Model with Restricted Boltzmann Machine

This repository features a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) implementation
for the Kitaev Honeycomb Model. The code is easily extensible with new models
and lattices. However, by now, it solely focuses on the Kitaev Honeycomb Model.

### Building

The program is dependend of `Eigen3` and `Boost` and is only developed for UNIX
based systems. To build the code, simply run

```
make
```
